        <h2>WHAT TO DO:</h2>
        <p><b>1.Trekking:</b>A collection of solid rock structures, Shivagange offers climbers an exciting and tough trek. Being a rocky hill, the climb is difficult but thanks to the railings put up all along the way it becomes significantly safer.Every half a kilometer, there's a food stall so that you can take an energy break from the tedious climb. There are also temples at regular intervals that provide for good photo ops. There are also man made steps connecting the temples. The last leg of the climb is the toughest as the hill becomes steeper. The topmost point of the hill has a Nandi (Holy Bull) craved from a single monolithic stone. The climb here is risky but is worth the effort for the view from the top is breathtaking</p>
        <p><b>2.Temples</b>Shivagange Hillock appears to look like a Shiva Linga from the distance. It houses five temples. At the entrance, you're greeted by a life size statue of Lord Ganesha and the Gagadeshwar Temple (Shiva Temple)</p>
