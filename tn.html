        <h2>VALPARAI</h2>
        <p>Situated at 1500m above sea level in the Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu, Valparai is an obscure yet tranquil hill station in the Anamalai Hills. Its alluring combination of grassy knolls, clean air, and picturesque sights entice tourists from all over the country and beyond, rendering it one of the most sought-after destinations in the southern region of the Western Ghats.It is the haven of those who yearn to visit similar hill stations like Ooty, Kodaikanal, and Coorg but are discouraged by the eruption of vacation-footfall in those places. Everyone -- from corporate workers or students seeking respite from the noise of their urban lives to nature-loving souls and trekking-enthusiasts -- can gain something worthwhile from travelling to and staying at Valparai. It truly is the 'seventh heaven'.Propelled by an economy that comprises largely of coffee and tea estates, this idyllic hill station also flourishes because of its thriving tourism industry. Yet it also inheres a rich heritage for those with an appreciation for history and culture. Its monuments and temples stand out as major attractions in this regard.</p>
        <p><b>When To Visit:</b>October to November and March to May.</p>

        <h2>DHANUSHKODI</h2>
        <p>One of the most exotic adornments in the vast coastline of Tamil Nadu is the picturesque Dhanushkodi Beach. A highly popular tourism hotspot, Dhanushkodi Beach is visited by lakhs of tourists every year from all over the world. This pristine beach is surrounded by the Gulf of Mannar on one side and the Bay of Bengal on the other. Resting on the southern tip of Tamil Nadu, this amazing beach destination is a place rich in history, myths and beauty.The word Dhanushkodi means ‘Tip of the bow’. ‘Arichal Munai’ is the point at which the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the spot can be viewed from Dhanushkodi. It is believed that Lord Rama, from the Indian epic of Ramayana, pointed to the end of his bow and asked his troops to build a bridge across the ocean to reach the demon king Ravana’s Lanka. Ravana had abducted Rama’s wife Sita and Rama had to reach Lanka to rescue her. Thus this place occupies a significant and important position in Indian mythology and history.</p>
