        <h2>CHOPTA</h2>
        <p>Chopta Popularly referred to as the ‘mini Switzerland’ of Uttarakhand, Chopta (at an approximate altitude of 2,608 m) is a slice of paradise tucked away in the Garhwal Himalayas. Surrounded by bugyals or velvety meadows and pristine snow-capped peaks, Chopta is an all-year holiday destination: pleasant in summer, rain-fresh in monsoon and a snow-clad fairyland in winter. Chopta is at the epicentre of the Panch Kedar – the five most sacred Shiva temples in the state. On its left are located Kedarnath and Madmaheshwar shrines and on the right, Rudranath and Kalpeshwar, and just above it, the Tungnath temple. Chopta is a birding paradise and you can see over 240 species of birds here, including native and migratory species like Himalayan monal, Himalayan swiftlet, Himalayan griffon, scarlet finch, hill partridge, and so on. Nearby places like Dugalbitta, Mandal village, Makkumath and the Tungnath trek route are the best sites for watching our feathered friends. Chopta has been declared as an important bird-watching site by national and international conservation and biodiversity organisations.</p>
        <p> <b> When to visit:</b><br> Chopta is ideal for vacations all over the year but November to May are the best months to visit.</p>
        <h2>WHAT TO DO:</h2>
        <p><b>1. Trekking: </b> Chopta is known for several trekking routes that run through it and around it. One of the most popular routes is to the Chandrashila peak, a trek of around 9 km. En route falls the sacred Tungnath temple, the highest Shiva shrine in the world. This trek is best enjoyed between December and January. In winter, this route is covered in snow and the experience is exhilarating.</p>
        <p><b>2.Mountain Biking:</b>Taking to the mountain roads in and around Chopta on a motored bike or a cycle is a must-try. The roads are smooth and surrounded by rolling green meadows and offer views of snow-capped peaks. There are cycling events organised here as well. Chopta to Ukhimath via Sari village, a distance of 30 km, is a popular cycling route.</p>

        <h2>MADHYAMAHESHWAR</h2>
        <p>Sitting pretty on the foothills of towering peaks in the state's Garhwal region, Madhyamaheshwar (also known as Madhmaheshwar) is a revered religious site. One of the Panch Kedars (holy temples dedicated to Lord Shiva), Madhyamaheshwar is located in the district of Rudraprayag and is steeped in mythology and folklore. According to legend, after the epic Mahabharat war, the Pandavas wanted to pay reverence to Lord Shiva in order to absolve them from their sin. On sighting the approaching Pandavas, Lord Shiva turned into a bull in order to illude them. But Bhima, one of the five Pandava brothers, recognised the Lord and pursued him relentlessly. Lord Shiva divided his body into five parts to escape Bhima. The sites where the five parts of the Lord appeared are revered as the Panch Kedar. The middle-torso of the Lord is said to have appeared in Madhyamaheshwar ('madhya' in Hindi means middle). To reach the temple, visitors and pilgrims embark on a tedious 24-km-long trek. This arduous hike, however, is worth the effort as visitors are treated to uninterrupted views of green land and surrounding mountains. The temple stands opposite the Chaukhamba, Neelkanth and Kedarnath mountain peaks.</p>
        <p><b>When To Visit:</b>Between the months of May and September</p>
        <h2>WHAT TO DO:</h2>
        <p><b>1. Trekking: </b>Being a Madhyamaheshwar s a high-altitude destination, Madhyamaheshwar offers a few of the most memorable and scenic trekking routes in the Garhwal region. From the Madhyamaheshwar trek and the Buda Madhyamaheshwar trek to the Nandikund trek – there is no dearth of routes to explore here.</p>
        <p><b>2. Camping: </b>Camping is another activity visitors to Madhyamaheshwar can enjoy. Ransi is the base camp of the Madhyamaheshwar trek. Camps can also be set up at Lower Bantoli (Choti Bantoli) or Upper Bantoli (Badi Bantoli). Brave hearts can pitch their tents near the Madhyamaheshwar temple</p>

        <h2>KANATAL</h2>
        <p>If discovering forest trails, dining by the stream and chasing mountain goats across velvet-soft grassland is your idea of a holiday, come to Kanatal. Close to the more popular Mussoorie, Kanatal offers a chance to stay close to nature and off the grid.

In winter, Kanatal receives snow and turns into a magical land.</p>
        <p><b>BEST TIME TO VISIT:</b>The ideal time to visit Kanatal is from April to October. It receives snow from December to February.</p>
